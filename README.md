## Introduction

# ![drevalpy_summary](assets/dreval_summary.svg)

**DrEval** is a bioinformatics framework that includes a PyPI package (drevalpy) and a Nextflow
pipeline (this repo). DrEval ensures that evaluations are statistically sound, biologically
meaningful, and reproducible. DrEval simplifies the implementation of drug response prediction
models, allowing researchers to focus on advancing their modeling innovations by automating
standardized evaluation protocols and preprocessing workflows. With DrEval, hyperparameter
tuning is fair and consistent. With its flexible model interface, DrEval supports any model type,
ranging from statistical models to complex neural networks. By contributing your model to the
DrEval catalog, you can increase your work's exposure, reusability, and transferability.

1. The response data is loaded
2. All models are trained and evaluated in a cross-validation setting
3. For each CV split, the best hyperparameters are determined using a grid search per model
4. The model is trained on the full training set (train & validation) with the best
   hyperparameters to predict the test set
5. If randomization tests are enabled, the model is trained on the full training set with the best
   hyperparameters to predict the randomized test set
6. If robustness tests are enabled, the model is trained N times on the full training set with the
   best hyperparameters
7. Plots are created summarizing the results

For baseline models, no randomization or robustness tests are performed.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/drugresponseeval \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --models <RandomForest,model2,...> \
   --baselines <NaiveMeanEffectsPredictor,baseline2,...> \
   --dataset_name <CTRPv2|CTRPv1|CCLE|GDSC1|GDSC2|custom_dataset>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/drugresponseeval/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/drugresponseeval/parameters).

## Pipeline output

To see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/drugresponseeval/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
